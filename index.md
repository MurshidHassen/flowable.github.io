			<h3>The Flowable Project</h3>
			<div class="description"><p>The Flowable project provides a core set of open source business process engines that are compact and highly efficient.  They provide a workflow and Business Process Management (BPM) platform for developers, system admins and business users.</p>
			<p> At its heart is a lightning fast, tried and tested dynamic BPMN process engine, with accompanying DMN decision tables and CMMN case management engines, all written in Java.  They are Apache 2.0 licensed open source, with a committed community.</p>
			<p>All the engines can run embedded in a Java application, or as a service on a server, a cluster, and in the cloud.  They can run as independent engines or services, or integrate together to provide a rich suite for business process management. They integrate perfectly with Spring.  With rich Java and REST APIs, they are the ideal base for orchestrating human or robotic automation processing.  They enable microservice orchestration or softwire the microservices themselves.</p>

				<div class="description"><p>The Flowable process engine has many years of real world use to ensure fast, efficient and reliable process execution. The DMN and CMMN engines have the same architecture and experience applied to them. Drive the engines through their rich java and REST APIs, and let them drive your services through their rich integration.</p></div>

				<div class="description"><p>Flowable provides a web based process designer as well as an Eclipse plug-in. With either of these you can quickly create open standard BPMN process models. The web designer also supports the creation of decision table (DMN), case management (CMMN) and form models, which can be combined with your process model to create complete process apps.</p></div>

				<div class="description"><p>A lightweight and extensible end user UI built with Angular provides an instant way of starting processes or working with tasks and forms. Use these applications out of the box, or customize and extend their components. Alternatively, use the rich set of APIs to build your own custom application UI.  Both business user and administration applications are provided. </p></div>
